Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool that evaluates password security by analyzing character composition (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and whitespace). It assigns a strength score (1-5) and provides feedback on improving password security. This project helps users create stronger passwords and can be integrated into security systems or cybersecurity awareness programs.
