Password Strength Checker is a Python-based tool that evaluates password security by analyzing character composition (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters, and whitespace). It assigns a strength score (1-5) and provides feedback on improving password security. This project helps users create stronger passwords and can be integrated into security systems or cybersecurity awareness programs.

**Summary of Logic**
1. Ask if the user wants to check a password
2. Take password input
3. Count different character types
4. Calculate password strength score
5. Assign strength remarks
6. Display password breakdown & strength rating
7. Ask if the user wants to check another password
8. Repeat or exit based on user input
